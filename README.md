### Good day to you!

This project is meant to practice html, css, js skills by creating a simple login form.

Assignment: - Create a cool login form. (See this codepen: https://codepen.io/dsenneff/details/2c3e5bc86b372d5424b00edaf4990173) it's a great animation that reacts to the user's input in a login form. Can you replicate something similar to this, using perhaps different JPG/PNG images that change depending on the state of the form?
